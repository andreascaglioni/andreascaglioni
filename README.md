# Andrea Scaglioni
- I am an **Applied Mathematician** and **Computational Scientist** focusing on the numerics of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
- During my Ph.D. at TU Vienna (Austria), I worked on methods for **Stochastic PDEs** and **Random Coefficient PDEs**. I am especially interested in nonlinear, time-dependent problems.
- I focus on **Sparse Grid interpolation**, which can approximate high-dimensional sparse functions with possibly dimension-independent accuracy, based only on point samples.
 [See my CV](https://andreascaglioni.net/cv/) for more on my work and skills.
- <Mark>**I am open to work!**</Mark> If you are looking for someone with my profile, please [get in touch with me](https://andreascaglioni.net/contacts/).
<!-- 
- See my [blog post about sparse grid interpolation](https://andreascaglioni.net/...).
- Check out [SGMethods](https://github.com/andreascaglioni/SGMethods), my Python implementations of sparse grid interpolation. I wrote it for my research, then polished it and made it public for everyone to enjoy! If you are interested in contributing, please [get in touch with me](https://andreascaglioni.net/contacts/).
- Fun Fact: I am passionate about photography. See some of my favorite photos at [photo.andreascaglioni.net](https://photoasphoto.netlify.app/).
